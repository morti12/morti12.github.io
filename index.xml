    <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently switched to Linux full-time and one of the first hurdles was getting my cloud storage to feel native. I use OneDrive for a lot of stuff, and I wanted it to just be there in my file manager when I boot up my machine, Yes I know, on one hand you say good bye to Windows and on the other hand you are still using the services. I use OneDrive because my whole family needs Office and also a cloud storage, and I have to admit, that the family package is cheap 🤑. After a bit of tinkering, I found a pretty sweet setup using <code>rclone</code> and <code>systemd</code>. Let me show you how I did it! 🤓</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Every good program starts with a lovely <code>Hello World</code>. So this dev blog should also start with it. On the other hand, it is also a chance for me to get to know <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Hugo</a> and I also want to introduce myself. Two birds with one stone 🤘</p>
